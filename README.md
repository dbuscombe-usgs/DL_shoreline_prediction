# Convolutional Neural Networks to predict shoreline change

Here you can find the alongshore-averaged cross-shore position time series for Tairua Beach, wave data, and code of the CNNs and CNN-LSTM models to reproduce the results in the paper by [Gomez-de la Pena et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-958). Authors: Eduardo Gomez-de la Pena, Giovanni Coco, Colin Whittaker, and Jennifer Montano. The original shoreline and wave data were curated by co-author JM and used in the publication by [Monta√±o et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090587) . Earlier versions of the shoreline data set can be found at the [Coast and Ocean Collective webiste](https://coastalhub.science/data)
